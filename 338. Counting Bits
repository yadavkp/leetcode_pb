what is the pb-> given an integer, iterate from 0 to n. for each i count how many set bit are there in binary representation, and store in the vector, then return vector.

what logic-> init a vector  and iterate each i from 0 to n. for each i, i will count how many set bits are there by the help of loop or inbuile function(__builtin_popcount)
                       after that push_back them in the vector.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        
        vector<int> bit;
        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){
            int cnt=0;
            int p = i;
            while(p>0){
                if(p&1)cnt++;
                p >>= 1;
            }
            //bit.push_back(__builtin_popcount(i));
            bit.push_back(cnt);
        }
        return bit;
    }
};
