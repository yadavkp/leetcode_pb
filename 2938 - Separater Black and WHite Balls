what pb ->  given a string which contaions then only binary values,0,1 , let's call it 1 is black and 0 is white, you need to group these number so that 
          all white go to the left side and all white go to the right side ,after perfroming any operation (condition is you should choose always two adjacent num)

what logic ->  intialise two pointer one is left=0,right =0;
             1 > first we need to find where "0" string contain , if find 0, then count step by diff of abs(right - left),and then increment left pointer by 1, this operaioin you
               can you till you reached n.

               so final ans will be total steps->

    for more details understanding refers my code->

    class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumSteps(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        long long l=0,r=0,res = 0;
        for(r = 0;r<n;r++){
            if(s[r] == '0'){
                res += (r - l);
                l++;
            }
        }
        return res; 

    }
};
