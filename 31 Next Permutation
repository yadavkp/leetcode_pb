what logic -> method -> 1->  for finding next greater Permutation you can use Inbuilt function that is    next_permutation(nums.begin(),nums.end());
 method-2 >> first here is 4 steps to find nexxt greater ->
            s-> 1  first find the decreasing num from right to left let's call it as pivot-
            s -> 2 after that find the smallest largest num from right to left which is greater than pivot
            s ->3 swap thos num like(nums[pivot],nums[first smallest largest]
            s -> 4 reverse theat num after pivot 
            s-5 > finally you can get the ans

  //for more detail you can refers my code -> 


  class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(),i = n-2;

        while(i>=0 && nums[i] >= nums[i+1]){
            i--;
        }
        if(i>=0){

            int j = n-1;

            while(nums[j]<=nums[i]){
                j--;
            }
            swap(nums[i],nums[j]);
        }
        reverse(nums.begin()+i+1,nums.end());
        
        //next_permutation(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        
    }
};
