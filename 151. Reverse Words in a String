what pb-> it simply a given string containing word with two or more space 
solution -> you need to print the string in reverse order with only space between the word
what logic ->  first we concatenated string in stringstream (which is used for extracted word one by one from stringstream append to the resulting string  )

detailed code
               stringstream ss(s1);
               string result = "";
             while(ss >> curr){
                       if(!result.empty()){
                               result = curr + " " + result; 
                       else{
                                 result = curr;
