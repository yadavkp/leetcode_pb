what pb -> you can maximise product of a and b by changing at most n bit 
        
       max prodcut of two number occur when two number very close to each other (5 * 5 = 25 ,(if two num have sum 10 , no any factor occur have product grater than 25 ))
logic-> so first we create mask to each i till n-1
           and that mask , now we check at ith position a and b has set bit or unset bit.
           c-1 when a and b both has ith bit set we ignore( that already has max product no need to change's the bit)
           c-2 when a has set bit (and b has 0 on the ith bit ) now check if a > b
                                                                then reduce a by xor by mask 
                                                                 and increase b by or(operator) by mask    (  aisa krne se both a and b reached to very close)


            c-3 if b has a set bit on ith posn  and a has 0 on ith posn   -> if(b > a) 
                                                                           then reduce b by xor with mask
                                                                              increased a by or opn with mask
           c-4 if a and b has both 0 bit on ith posn 
                      then maximise both a and b by performing or operation



  for more detail refer's my code->
  class Solution {
public:
    int maximumXorProduct(long long a, long long b, int n) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        for(int i = n-1;i >= 0; i--){
            long long mask = (long long)1 << i;
            if((a & mask) && (b & mask)){
                continue;
            }else if(a & mask){
                if(a > b){
                    a ^= mask;
                    b |= mask;
                }
            }else if(b & mask){
                   if(a < b){
                       a |= mask;
                       b ^= mask;
                   }
            }else{
                a |= mask;
                b |= mask;
            }
        }
        a = a%mod;
        b = b%mod;

        return (1LL * a * b) % mod;
        
    }
};
