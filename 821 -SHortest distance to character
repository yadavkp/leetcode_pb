what pb -> we need to find shortest distance of each charactr to by a one given character ->
 what logic ->  one mehtod is based on bruteforce -> using two for loop you can find the min dist of curr character by a given charater-

2nd Method -> first declare a array has length n , and its at every place value will be n.
           -> initialise the prev which is value -n(it means max distance of character to given characer)
            iterate string from left to right if char is matched then update prev, and set vector ith position by i-prev;

            again declare prev = 2*n;
            iterate from right to left , if the curr char is matched with the given character - then update prev,and set vector ith position by a ans[i] = min(ans[i],prev - j)

  for more detail refers the code solution ->
   class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestToChar(string s, char c) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> ans(n,n);

        int prev = -n;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(s[i] == c) prev = i;;
            ans[i] = i - prev;
        }
         prev = 2*n;
        for(int j = n-1;j >= 0 ;j--){
            if(s[j] == c) prev = j;
            ans[j] = min(ans[j],prev - j);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
